# consumerReviewsAnalysis
Hello Beats executives, externship program managers, and others! This is the repository for my analysis of the consumer survey questions.  In this analysis, I used Pandas to clean and analyze the data found in the Google Sheet. 

Here were my findings:
The most important factor that most users consider when looking for speakers is sound quality, while durability and design are the least impactful.
Once they decide on a speaker, most users find the most pursuasive call to action is recommendation from family or friends, followed by online reviews.
However, it seems that niche features are the least pursuasive. The most common wireless-speaker customer is an 18-24 year old female, with a household
income of over $100,000 / year. JBL is the most commonly bought speaker of this sample, while Amazon Echo and Anker Speakers have the highest satisfaction
ratings. Most Customers buy wireless speakers on large, multi-brand stores like Amazon. Finally, the most common use case is listening to music, with most users
using the speaker several times a week. It is important to note that the sample size for these calculations was 20, which means that some calculations could be
incredibly innaccurate, as the sample size does not allow for a smooth distribution of values. 

I hope you enjoy the code!
